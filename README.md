# What is this repo about?

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in High Dimensional Probability by Roman Vershynin. The book draft is available online [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~romanv/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf).

I will keep adding the solutions as I progress through the book, and even then I may not be able to solve some of the difficult problems. Please feel free to point out errors by raising issues.
